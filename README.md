# LinkedBinarySearchTree
A realization of binary search tree

To show the efficiency of tree usage, try demo_bst method for a 'words.txt' file

It prints the result of finding the same 10 000 randomly generated words using different methods.

The slowest turned out to be a Pathological Binary Tree.

The fastest is a Balanced Binary Tree.

Interestingly enough, the random shuffled tree was very close to the same performance.

As can be seen on the picture, an ordinary list index method was extremely slow when compared to log2(n).
